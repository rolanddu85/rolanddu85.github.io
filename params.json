But recently, I have realized that I am way out of touch with many new technologies & languages, so I decided to start seriously learning and working on projects outside of work.\r\n\r\n## My Current Progress\r\n### 1. Creating the main page\r\nThis is my first time creating a webpage, so I am still trying to grasp the basics. I am currently learning the basics of CSS and working on getting my main page of GitHub Pages looking good. For anyone else that may be interested, some resources that I am using as guides include:\r\n* [How I built my blog in one day](http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/)\r\n* [Webdev Resources (Reddit post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1v7en8/webdev_resources/)  \r\n  \r\n(Yes, as much as it pains me, I do often spend too much time browsing Reddit)  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
