                <p>It has been more than 2 years now since I have graduated college, and I have worked as a middle-end developer using proprietary software ever since. But recently, I have realized that I am way out of touch with many new technologies &amp; languages, so I decided to start seriously learning and working on projects outside of work.</p>

<a id="1-creating-the-main-page" class="anchor" href="#1-creating-the-main-page" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Creating the main page</h3>

                <p>This is my first time creating a webpage, so I am still trying to grasp the basics. I am currently learning the basics of CSS and working on getting my main page of GitHub Pages looking good. To get things started, I decided to use the autogenerate feature on GitHub, but plan on using Bootstrap afterwards. If anyone is interested, these are some of the resources that I am using as guides:</p>
